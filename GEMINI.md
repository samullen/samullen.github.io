This is the repo of my personal blog. It's hosted on GitHub, but can be found at
samuelmullen.com.

It's a Jekyll site, so it is built and deployed as static HTML pages.

# Execution

Serving the site locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
Building the site: `bundle exec jekyll build`

# Project Structure

*   `_posts`: Contains all the blog posts.
*   `_includes`: Contains reusable HTML components like the header and footer.
*   `_layouts`: Defines the structure for different page types.
*   `assets`: Holds static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.

# Dependencies

This project uses Bundler to manage Ruby gems. Dependencies are listed in the
`Gemfile`. You can install them by running `bundle install`.
