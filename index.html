      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I live in Kansas City with my beautiful wife, our two great kids, and
      our dog and cat. When I'm not working, you can probably find me at the
      soccer field, working out, reading, or enjoying the many restaurants
      Kansas City has to offer</p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>

      <h2>Get in touch</h2>

      other people get what they want." I believe that, and try to live by it
      as best as I can. If you need help with a project, understanding a concept, or anything else, <a href="/contact">Reach out. I'm happy to help.</a></p>
