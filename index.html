      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I live in Kansas City with my beautiful wife, our two great kids, and
      our dog and cat. When I'm not working, you can find me playing bass
      guitar, building something with wood, reading, or enjoying the many
      restaurants Kansas City has to offer</p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>I lead engineering teams to turn ideas into reliable, scalable
      software. My work is about more than shipping code—it's about creating
      the right environment for teams to thrive, products to grow, and
      customers to succeed.</p>
