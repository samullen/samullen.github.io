I've been using "Shush" since the first time I heard about on the 
[Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com) podcast a couple years ago. As an
independent, I have to be on a lot of phone calls, and that can be a problem
when you work out of your house: kids play, dogs bark, the AC runs, and the cow
says "Moo". "Shush" allows me to mute all of that...at least for those on the
other end of the call.

The app is as simple as it gets. It has two modes: "push-to-talk" and
"push-to-silence". If it's in "push-to-talk" mode, then you just need to hold
down the "hotkey" (the default is the "fn" key) to speak - just like a
walkie-talkie. "Push-to-silence" works in the opposite manner. There's a tiny
bit more configuration you can do, but not much; it doesn't need much more.

I've only used it with the Mac's internal mic, my [Blue Yeti](http://www.bluemic.com/yeti/) microphone, and a crummy little headset: Shush worked perfectly with all of them.

My only complaint with "Shush" is that occasionally the menu bar icon gets
confused about what state it's in: it'll show the mic is unmuted when my finger
isn't on the hotkey. This is a problem, but one which can be solved by quitting
the app and restarting it. Just to be safe, I'm in the habit of restarting
"Shush" before every phone call. Like I said, it's a complaint, but one I
really don't have to deal with frequently.

I'm a big fan of "Shush" and I highly recommend this app to anyone who uses
their Mac for voice/video conferences.
