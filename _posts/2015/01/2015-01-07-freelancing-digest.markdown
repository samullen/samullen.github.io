Being a freelancer can be tough. We often work alone, isolated from our peers,
and without a guide to tell us what we're doing right or wrong. Should I work
with this client? What business entity should I operate under? When should I
increase my rates? What do I do about taxes? These questions and more are asked
by both new and veteran freelancers, and finding answers in all the noise can be
overwhelming.

On January 1, 2015, I launched [Freelancing
Digest](http://freelancingdigest.com) to help with some of that. Freelancing
Digest is a newsletter distributed on the 1st and 15th of the month, and
contains links to some of the best articles on the web about freelancing. The
artcles aren't limited to a specific industry or to what is currently in
fashion, but will be a mix of new and classic posts and from a variety of
perspectives.

This is the newsletter I wish I had when I started, and I really hope it's a
help to you in your career. 

You can sign up on the form to the right or on the [Freelancing
Digest's](http://freelancingdigest.com) main site.
