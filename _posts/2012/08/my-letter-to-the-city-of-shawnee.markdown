As a rule, I don't post anything relating to politics, but since this has
nothing to do with the banalities of left vs. right vs. independents, I am
making an exception.

I am so completely excited about [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com), I
could burst, and I am terrified that rather than opening our doors to the future
and to future growth, our local governments will instead see this as an
opportunity to make a buck and flex its muscles.

The Internet represents freedom. We need to open our arms to it.

> Ladies and Gentlemen of the Governing Body of Shawnee,

> My name is Samuel Mullen. I'm a freelance programmer specializing in web and
> iPhone development. As such, I am very keen to learn what, if anything, has been

> distance from the initial locations selected by Google, but they will inevitably
> spread out, and I am anxious for it's arrival. I am convinced my business can
> only grow with its arrival: through new companies, technological improvements,
> and networking.
> 
> I believe the greater Kansas City metro area is in a unique position to usurp
> the technology crown which Silicon Valley currently wears. New businesses, new
> ideas, new people, and new opportunities are all on the horizon, we must be
> prepared to take up the mantle of Silicon Prairie.
> 
> Please let me know that you, the current leaders of Shawnee, are as excited
> about this technology as I am, and that you are doing everything in your power
> to eliminate road blocks which might hinder the arrival of Google Fiber.

> Thank you,
> Samuel Mullen

If you live in the Kansas City metro area and you are not part of the Google
Fiber rollout, I would encourage you to contact your city officials as well.

### Update: August 24, 2012

[The City of Shawnee](http://cityofshawnee.org) did end up reaching out to
Google. This is [their letter](http://www.cityofshawnee.org/WEB/ShawneeCMS.nsf/vwNews/3FAF13B950ED405086257A6A005F1010?OpenDocument).
