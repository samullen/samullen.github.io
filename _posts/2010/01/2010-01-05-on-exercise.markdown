Somewhere in our distant past, some crackhead with more brawn than brains, came up with the singularly confused idea to inflict upon himself all manner of ritualistic bodily exertions in the name of health and vanity. Rather than putting the poor bastard out of his misery right then and there, those around him concluded that this "exercise" thing was a right and good idea.

As millions of other people - myself included - have also agreed that this is a good idea, I must conclude that exercise is neither an activity nor a lifestyle, but rather an infectious disease. If I may speak for the countless number of people who have, throughout the years, been inflicted with this painful disease: I truly hope that first exercise nut finds a particularl dark, nasty, and fiery place in Hell where he can keep any other confused ideas to himself.
