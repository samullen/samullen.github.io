Yeah, [Google Buzz](http://buzz.google.com) is cool, and I like that it won't suffer from the scalability issues that [Twitter](http://twitter.com) does. But like Twitter, it's just a status updater. It's great in that it binds in with social sites and all that, but I don't need it; it's just another distraction. I'll probably hook Buzz up to posterous when the API is released, but I don't see myself using Buzz any more than that.

What I need is for [ma.gnolia](http://gnolia.com) to come back from the dead. I only cared about the links anyway.
