I finished listening to a podcast [interview with Salman Khan](http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4386.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+channel/itc+(IT+Conversations) from [IT Conversations](http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org) yesterday. Salmon runs a not-for-profit organization called [Khan Acadamy](http://khanacademy.org/) which has a "mission of providing a high quality education to anyone, anywhere." The site has links to a "1000+ videos on [YouTube](http://youtube.com) covering everything from basic arithmetic and algebra to differential equations, physics, chemistry, biology and finance," all of which have been created by Mr. Khan. Along with his Videos, Mr. Khan has also created software which will allow you (or your students) to test yourself to see if you are ready for the next step of study.

The interview was really great and a couple of interesting ideas for alternative methods of teaching in the classroom were explored: I personally like the idea of watching videos on your own and using class-time as a more Q&A/conversation session.

As a resource for homeschoolers - or really anyone who is interested in furthering their education - Khan's site really has a lot to offer.

Check out [the interview](http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4386.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+channel/itc+(IT+Conversations)) and then check out [his site](http://khanacademy.org/).
