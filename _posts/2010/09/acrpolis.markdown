A  phalanx was a military formation used in ancient warfare. In such a  formation, soldiers (hoplites) would line up row upon row in close  formation, locking their shields together, and thrust their spears and  sword out over the shield wall.

In such a formation, every  soldier was dependent upon his comrades for support and protection. The  entire phalanx had to have the same goal and be determined to achieve  that goal in order to succeed. Any weakness in the wall would likely  result in defeat for the entire formation; there were rarely second  chances.

## Mutual Goals
Like  those ancient warriors, we at Phalanx recognize that we must adopt the  goals of those with whom we partner. It is clear to us that we must have  the same focus, the same priorities, the same passion, and the same  determination as our partners in order to attain our mutual goals.

## Mutual Dependence
It  is also clear to us the interdependence we share with our clients. In  much the same way as the soldier in the front line of a phalanx was  dependent upon those around him and had to trust that they would defend  and fight along side him, we at Phalanx are very aware of the trust  which is given to us and we strive to maintain and strengthen that trust  by providing the best service and seeking what is best for our  partners.

## Mutual Success
When  our goals match our partners' and when we pursue their best interests,  we are working as a single cohesive unit with an unwavering eye upon the  prize. When this happens, the only possible outcome which can result is  success.
