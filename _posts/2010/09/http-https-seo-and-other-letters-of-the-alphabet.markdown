## SEO - What is it?
SEO  stands for “Search Engine Optimization”. What it really means is  designing your websites so that Search Engines (e.g. Google, Bing, etc.)  can better catalog and rank it. Many things are involved in this  process: from making sure each page is titled well, to creating site  maps, and even labeling images appropriately. The point of each change -  each optimization - is to help search engines better understand what  your site is about so that your site ranks better against user queries.

## How Search Engines Work
Search  engines, such as Google and Bing, use applications called spiders to  crawl the Web. When a spider comes to a website, it indexes the  “valuable” words on the first page it comes to and then proceeds to  follow each and every link on the page. With each page discovered, the  spider follows the same pattern: 1) index the page; 2) follow the links;  3) repeat.

In the early days of the web, websites would use the same key words -  the valuable words mentioned above - over and over again on a web page  for the sole purpose of increasing its visibility and value to search  engines. Websites which had nothing to do with a particular industry  might nevertheless use key words from that other industry in order to  rank better with search engines. For example, an e-commerce site selling  aroma therapy candles, might use “hidden” key words from other  industries such as politics, technology, or medicine to become more  visible.

This practice changed with the advent of Google’s page rank algorithm.  Rather than ranking a site’s importance by how many times the word  “candle” appeared on the page, Google began ranking sites according to  how many times the site was linked to from other sites. If the other  sites were ranked highly, then the linked to site would would also rise  in value. Key words are still important, but only with regard to what a  site is about and not how valuable the site is.

## HTTP vs. HTTPS - Does it Matter?
With  our understanding of how search engines work, we can now address the  question, “Does implementing a secure layer on a site hinder SEO?”

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. This “protocol” is really  just an agreement between two computers about how to transfer  information. In the case of HTTP, the two computers agree to transfer  HyperText information - one will send and one will receive. HyperText is  just the computer language we use to build web pages. (Hyper implies  that we’re going beyond just Text; we’ll use links, images, plugins,  video, etc.)

HTTPS, then, is the same thing, only with an added layer of Security  (the “S” in HTTPS) thrown on top. The information is encrypted so only  the computers which are communicating can understand it. Joe Hacker may  be able to see the information passed back and forth, but without the  secret keys, he’ll be unable to read it. Not so with HTTP.

So  does having an secure layer hinder SEO? In short, the answer is “No.”  Every
search company creates their spider application to understand both  standard and
secure websites. Matt Cutts, Google’s webspam team’s  chief, says, “either one
is fine; just pick one or the other and link to  it consistently. [http://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-for-http-and-https/15055/](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-for-http-and-https/15055/)

Consistency is the issue. Search engines recognize [//samuelmullen.com](//samuelmullen.com) and [https://samuelmullen.com](https://samuelmullen.com) (notice the ‘s’ in the second) as two separate sites, even if they are  not. If both URLs are linked to regularly, the result will be that the  site’s ranking will, on average, be halved or ignored. This is known as a  “duplicate content error”.

## Improving SEO - What You Can Do
Generally  speaking, most of the actions which can be taken to increase SEO will  require effort from your web site’s maintainer, but believe it or not,  you don’t have to be a technology whiz to play a part in increasing your  site’s visibility. Here’s a list of relatively simple things you can do to increase your site’s SEO:
* “Content is King”, so make sure your site has good, high-quality content that people want
* Make sure your content is fresh (i.e. updated regularly)
* Try  to get links pointing to your site to use descriptive words rather than  generic phrases. Example: “List of Classes” is much better than “Click  here”.
*  “If your site’s content doesn’t change often, your site needs a blog  because search spiders like fresh text. Blog at least three time a week  with good, fresh content to feed those little crawlers.”
*  Make sure your company is on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter,  and LinkedIn. (Note: as in point #4, you have to updated them  regularly)
*  Get your company listed in Google Places: [http://google.com/places](http://google.com/places)

## How Will I Know if My SEO is Working?
Unless  you add analytics to your website you will never really know if your  efforts are working. You may see an increase in sales or phone calls,  but without actual data to back it up, you can’t certain. Fortunately  Google offers a free service called Google Analytics which can easily be added  to your web site. Employing this service will allow you to see from  where your customers are coming (both in the real world and online),  what they are searching for, what pages they are viewing most often, and  more. Furthermore, you will actually be able to see your site’s traffic  increase or decrease daily. This will allow you to correlate your  actions to results.

If your site isn’t employing any of the simple techniques listed above  or in the references below, don’t get discouraged, because it’s not too  late to start. Search engines scour the Internet almost daily looking  for new content. Almost as soon as you start improving your site’s SEO,  search engines will begin taking notice and respond accordingly. This is  your site and your company, let the world know you’re in business.
