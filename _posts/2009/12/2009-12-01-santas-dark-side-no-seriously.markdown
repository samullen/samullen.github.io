As I was going through my daily list of sites this morning, I ran across the following t-shirt (okay, it's an image which is to be put on a t-shirt.) on [woot.com](http://woot.com).

I thought the site was joking about the Krampus when they said:

> You see, long ago, Santa had himself a dark helper who would go door to door with him on his gift-giving mission. When he arrived, if you were a good boy or girl, you'd get a nice present. If you were bad, Old St. Nick would sigh, shake his head, and then sic his demon assistant on you. The naughty child would then be terrorized, beaten, locked in chains, and, as a service to the parents, I'm guessing, put in the Krampus' own magic sack of inescapable horrors to be taken away, all while Santa finished up the cookies and milk.

But no, they're serious. Apparently the Krampus is a sort of anti-santa who would give warnings and punishments to bad children. "Traditionally, young men dress up as the Krampus in the first two weeks of December, particularly in the evening of December 5, and roam the streets frightening children and women with rusty chains and bells. In some rural areas the tradition also includes birching by Krampus, especially of young females." ([Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus))

Somehow I don't feel so bad joking about my kids only getting coal or underwear if they misbehave. That seems to be a bit more subdued than telling them they will be whipped by a demon and stolen away from us in the dead of night.

Merry Christmas...for some of you.
