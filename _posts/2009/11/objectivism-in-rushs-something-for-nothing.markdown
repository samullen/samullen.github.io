The following four lines from Rush's "Something for Nothing" appear to be heavily inspired by [Objectivist philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29):

> What you own is your own kingdom<br/>
> What you do is your own glory<br/>
> What you love is your own power<br/>
> What you live is your own story<br/>

At the very least, they're very inspiring and motivating.
