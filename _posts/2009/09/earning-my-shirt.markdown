Every year on Father's Day, I get a "Dad shirt." They're just t-shirts with a statement to the effect of, "I'm a great dad." The first year the shirt said, "Fatherhood: The toughest job you'll ever love." The next year I got a matching hat with the shirt, both saying, "Dad #1". This year my kids both got to put their hand prints on the shirt which said, "Best dad in the world, hands down." Many dads hate this sort of gift and several have mocked me for wearing them, but these shirts are quickly becoming the staple of my wardrobe. I love knowing that my kids love me and think I'm a great dad, because every kid should be able to think his or her dad is great (whether they are or not).

Last night was a pivotal moment in my son's life: he learned to ride his bike. I was there when he said his first word and I was there when he took his first step, but this one was a little different for me. Maybe it was because it represented his growing independence or a newfound freedom for him, but it was very moving for me. Last night, I was able to fulfill my role as a dad and teach my son to ride a bike. Last night, I earned my dad shirt.

**Update**: Oct. 12, 2009

Someone jokingly asked if I taught my son to ride at night. Answer: No, I didn't. I got him riding about an hour earlier, but I didn't have the camera with me. By the time I got the camera, it was dark.

Really, I'm not that bad of a father.
