The soccer game was cancelled today because it rained last night and the fields have just been reseeded. With Ronda going back to working on weekends we really wanted to take advantage of one of our last weekends together as a family. I'm not sure where the idea came from, but I suggested that we go to Weston if they had started their autumn festivities. Thankfully they had.

We went to [Weston](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=weston+missouri&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Weston,+MO&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=wNa-Sqf9D8Oa8AbVydCgAQ&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A) when Mason was six months old and had a great time, but for whatever reason never went back. We tried doing other pumpkin patches or autumn events, but all of the places we tried always seemed just a bit run down. I think we'll be making Weston, and in particular the [Red Barn Farm](http://www.westonredbarnfarm.com), a yearly tradition from now on. They had just about everything you would expect for this sort of occasion: farm animals, tractors, hay bales, a gift shop, corn maze, hay rides, pony rides, etc. Oh, and did I mention pumpkins? They had at least sixteen different kinds of pumpkins in a myriad of colors: white, blue, orange, mottled, red, and more. We bought a white one and a short, fat red one.

I know it sounds corny to get excited about something like this, but we want our kids to have that sense of stability which comes from family traditions. We began a couple of years ago with our, now annual, Christmas Eve open house. We've now added to our traditions with an annual trip to Weston in the Fall.
