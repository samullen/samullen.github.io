We just got an aquarium over the weekend and my children have been hyper-excited about getting fish to fill it. We had planned to go last night, but that "hyper-excitement" eventually resulted in me sending them to their rooms. I still had every intention of taking them to the fish store, but they didn't know that.

When I called my son in today to talk to him about the way he had behaved, he asked me if we were still going to the fish store. I replied, "I haven't decided yet."

His response: "Then why are you putting on your shoes?"

Perceptive, logical, and altogether too clever. Whose child are you?
