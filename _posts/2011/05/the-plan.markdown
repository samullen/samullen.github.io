wife accepted a full-time position at [UnitedLex](http://unitedlex.com). Up
until now, Ronda has been the full-time mother of our children. It's not been an
easy road, but it's one we've gladly taken, because we thought it was what was
best for our family.

We still believe our kids are best served by having a parent in the home, and so as of June 3rd I will be leaving my full-time position at [Databasically](http://databasically.com) and I will begin my new position as full-time dad.

I will still be doing Ruby on Rails development, but I will be limited to mornings, evenings, and weekends (25-30 hours/wk). I'm hoping to pick up iOS development as well, but before I can do that, I have some new skills which I have to acquire first: taxiing, cooking, cleaning, teaching, etc.

With this transition, I will also be scuttling [Phalanx](http://phalanxit.com). Since Ronda will no longer have time to freelance, and since I've been playing with the idea for a while, it just made sense. I'm hoping - and I'm probably delusional for that - to write more frequently once things have settled down. I will now be freelancing through my own name; something I should have done from the very beginning.

I have no illusions about all of this. I don't expect it to be easy, but I look forward to every trial and triumph to come.
