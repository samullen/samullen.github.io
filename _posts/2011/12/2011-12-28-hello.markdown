On a whim, I decided to move my wordpress site to [Octopress](http://octopress.org).

I've managed to migrate all the content from the previous setup to Octopress, but the code snippets are jacked and the images are still pointing to WP.  I'll get this fixed in the near future. We'll see...

**Update: 20111231** - I've gone back through all my posts and fixed the images and code snippets.
