We are living in a system whose every aspect is broken. Not technology systems or even healthcare or political systems, by the whole system: from the subatomic to the lives we live to our interactions with others. And we know it to be true.

We see loved ones die from the ravages of disease and age, and we ask "Why?" We see men and women strive for - and deserve - greatness and yet they are greeted with defeat and failure time and time again, and we ask "Why?" We see criminals escape justice on a technicality, and we ask "Why?" Laws are created to curtail corruption, and yet corruption only increases, and we ask "Why?" Evil dictators rise to power on the backs of the people they subjugate, and the world applauds them, and we ask "Why?" We ask "Why?" and yet we know the answer: The system is broken.

But it is not just the systems we interact with which are broken, we ourselves are too. We know it when we fail or when we are weak. We know it also when are sick. We know it when we try to be "good" and wonder why we can't accomplish a single good deed out of a purely altruistic desire. We know it best, however, when we fail time and time again to stop doing what is wrong; when, in spite of wanting to do what is right, we do just the opposite.

We are broken and the system we live in is broken, but why is the system broken, and is there a fix?
