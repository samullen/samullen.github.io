I have only recently started running barefoot. I have no endurance, I'm not yet running every day, and as you can tell from most of my other postings, "I'm a programmer, not a doctor." So why listen to me? What could I offer you out of my ignorance? I can offer my three months of experience, which may be more than the experience of my intended audience.

As a little background, I've never been much of a runner. I have a [neuroma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton's_neuroma) in my left foot which has caused a lot of pain, and so running hasn't seemed like an option for an aerobic exercise. What I found out is that it was the constriction of my shoes which was causing the pain. By prohibiting my foot bones from spreading out with each step - away from the inflamed nerve - the shoes exacerbated the problem by localizing the pressure. Once I lost the shoes, the pain went away. But you can't run without shoes, that's crazy. Or is it?

As it turns out, barefoot running is on the rise, and there are a lot of arguments supporting the health benefits of running that way (links below). But I assume you know all that and are just looking for some tips to get started. Say no more.

### Tip 1: Lose the Shoes

Yeah, this may seem pretty obvious, but I'm not just talking about when you're running. I mean, as much as you can, stop wearing shoes. Do you coach soccer? Coach barefoot. Taking the dog for a walk? Walk barefoot. Going barefoot feels great. Not only does the texture of the ground feel good against your feet, but I've found that I can stand longer barefoot than when wearing shoes. There are some arguments for the [medical benefits to being barefoot](http://www.squidoo.com/walkbarefoot). Whatever the case, I just prefer it.

I don't care what the barefoot veterans say, you need some calluses. Pavement and concrete will chew through soft skin. Having some toughness to your feet will allow you to run farther, and the best way to build that toughness is to quit protecting your feet from the ground.

### Tip 2: Run Where It's Safe
Again, this probably sounds obvious, but I'm talking more about what to run on (i.e. the street, paved trails, or sidewalk), not where those surfaces are located.

If you are just beginning, you will find that your calf muscles are pretty week. As such, you will find yourself tempted to land heel first instead of ball-of-the-foot first. You can't run like that on pavement - well, not for long - and so you might be tempted to run in the grass. Don't do it, stay on the pavement. You can see what's on the sidewalk or the road, but you can't see what's hidden in the grass - and dog poo is the least of your worries. Nails, broken glass, or any other sort of hidden danger will ruin your day if your foot lands in the wrong spot.

Another thing to avoid is running through water, especially if it's raining. Yes, the water feels cool on your feet, but it doesn't take long for that cool water to dissolve the oils in your skin and start softening it up. Once that happens, blisters won't be far behind.

If your muscles are giving out on you during your run, end the run. Go home and let your muscles heal so you can run again in the next day or two. This brings me to my last tip.

### Tip 3: Listen to Your Feet

No one is going to think less of you because you can't immediately run a 5K barefoot (although they may think less of you when they find out you run barefoot).Building up your muscles, calluses, and endurance takes time. Forcing yourself to run through the pain is only going to cause more pain. Listen to your feet, if they're not ready to run again, or they can't run any more, stop!

### When to end your run
* As soon as you realize blisters are forming on your feet (I can't stress this enough)
* When you can no longer run on the balls of your feet
* If your feet are bleeding at all

Running barefoot isn't for everyone and it's not the best choice for everyone. I run barefoot because I need a simple aerobic exercise to complement my anaerobic exercises (i.e. resistance training). It's the right choice for me, but I did have to learn some lessons about how to run, where to run, what to avoid, and when I was ready.

I just go a pair of [Vibram Bikilas](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I9YASW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dumpgrou-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004I9YASW) for my birthday. I'll try to write up something about running with them in the near future. If you have your own tips, please, share them in the comment section below.
