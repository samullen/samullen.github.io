Words have always been associated with changes in the course of history. Jesus'
"It is finished", Julius Caesar's "The die is cast", and the Declaration of
Independence's "We the people..." were each at the fulcrum when history's events
completely shifted.

For those who have started businesses, it is likely they can look back upon a
conversation, an argument, an article, or even just a handful of words which
resonated with them. It was the tipping point which changed the course of their
history forever.

For me, it is this blog post.

## Choices

In Paul Graham's recent article, [Do Things That Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html), he wrote, "...startups take off because
the founders make them take off." Although it was written more as a lead-in to
the rest of the article, that one phrase resonated with me more than anything
else in his essay.

Like many people, I've either played around with the idea of a business or
started down the path to creating one. Book store, sports registration site,
bookmarking service, a chess site, and probably a couple of other things which
have fallen down the memory hole. They all kind of petered out for one reason or
another. Of course I know why, but I have no regrets. It was all by choice, and
arguably, the right choice.

This time around, I need to choose to succeed.

## Reasoning

That's why I'm writing this post and those which will follow. It's one thing to
start something and quit when only your wife knows what you've been goofing
around with, it's quite another when everyone in your community knows. By
putting this out there publicly I'm hoping it will provide the motivation -
through self-induced guilt-trips and fear of public humiliation - to pursue this
to the end, rather than stopping somewhere along the way.

More than just personal motivation, I'm hoping that journaling my progress will
also help to clarify things for myself. Things which need to be altered,
processes which need to be improved, and just providing me with clarity of
thought on the business. I'm also hoping my writing will be an encouragement for
others.

## Just Enough

The business will be a SaaS for businesses of a specific market. This means
there will be a web application with an eventual iOS and Android tie-in. The
application will be subscription-based and focused on a somewhat niche market,
but one which both needs the application and which has money. I have an advisor,
and through him, I will have access to subject matter experts (SME) and
beta-testers who can help me determine what the industry needs. But for the most
part, I'm on my own.

And that's as much as I'm going to say about the market and what I'm building.
It's just not that important or interesting to those on the outside.

## Frequency

I don't know what kind of frequency I'll be able to produce these posts. I'll
write when I can, but I also have to find time to work on the product and
business. If you weren't already aware, my day/night/evening/weekend/vacation
job is as an independent software developer, so I don't have a lot of time to
begin with. I usually write in the mornings, but even then I can get
side-tracked or stumped for a topic (topics are another reason for this series).

I am putting a lot of pressure on myself to make this business succeed. Some of
it's competitiveness with the Jones's, some of it is for my family, but a lot is
just out of a personal need to build something of my own. Obviously I'm worried
about failure, but failure's not the worst thing that can happen. The worst
thing that can happen is you come to the end of your life and realize you did
nothing with it.
