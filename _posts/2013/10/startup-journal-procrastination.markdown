Several weeks ago, I met a friend for lunch to discuss what we've each been
working on. I was excited about my product and began relating to him how much
progress I was making on the registration and authentication pieces, completing
the accounts pages, and how I was turning my attention to defining "plans".

Without missing a beat, Kenny just looked at me and asked very pointedly, "Why
are you wasting time on registration, when you should be working on the product
itself?" 

That stung a lot, but he was right. I should have been focusing on the product
itself, but there I was working on registration. At the time, I was convinced
registration had to be in place before I could even start on the main
application. Now I know I was just putting it off.

Unlike registration, the rest of the application is uncharted territory. I don't
know how things are done in the industry, what the workflows are like, or what
the user experience should be. (I'm basically trying to duplicate a real world
process on the computer without ever having actually seen the process being
performed.) Not having a clear idea of what to do is highly demotivating. So,
like most people, I gravitate toward activities I know until more is revealed
about the problem at hand. In this case, however, no more information was
forthcoming. I just needed to push through.

Getting that initial momentum is everything. Once that's acquired, building upon
it is easy. What seems to work well for me is staring blankly at the ceiling for
a little while – but not too long – trying to figure out how things will work,
and then drawing some basic wireframes on paper.

I don't know if it's the act of laying things out at that high of a level, of if
drawing opens up some part of my brain which knows what needs to be done, but
that's the pattern which seems to have emerged. Think, draw, do.

Since that lunch with Kenny, I've completed the first of the three major
components of the application, and have started working on the second.
Procrastination's still a problem – it always will be – but having friends to
keep you on track can sometimes be all the momentum you need.
