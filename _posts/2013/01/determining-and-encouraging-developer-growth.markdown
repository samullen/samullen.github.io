Excitement, frustration, discovery, passion, elation, disappointment, hunger,
failure, conquest, defeat, insight, freedom, dominance. These are not subtle
words, and I've chosen them because they are descriptive of programming, and
more specifically, growth as a programmer. Not one word standing above the
others, but all of them, in any order, and of varying durations. Do you know
these words? Do you know them now, or are they a memory?

I've been thinking a lot lately about how to determine if you're growing as a
programmer. It's easy to see growth when you are first beginning; you see the
progress of acquiring knowledge. But as your mastery increases, quantifying
growth moves from that based on knowledge, toward a growth based on
understanding and application. What are the metrics for determining growth then?

## An Experiment

To give us an idea if we are growing, let's try an experiment. Answer the
following questions:

* List three new things you've learned in the last week about your current
  technology of preference.
* What new idea, concept, pattern, or technique have you played with or tried to
  use in the past week.
* What was the last technical book you read for fun? When did you read it?
* Do you program outside of work? (For fun, not freelancing)
* When was the last time you had an exciting conversation with a peer about
  programming?
* Do you look forward to going to work?

Did your responses to those questions give you an idea about your current state
of growth?  Simply put, the best metric for determining if you are learning and
growing as a programmer - probably as anything - is this: "Are you having fun?"

So, are you?

Go back to the first sentence of this post. When in your programming career have
you felt those words most intensely? When you were learning, right? But weren't
you also enjoying yourself? Weren't you having fun?

## Being Stuck

If you had trouble providing positive answers for the questions above, maybe
you're in a bad spot. I know what that's like. I know what it's like to have
every idea shot down because that's "not how we do things." I know what it's
like to have your creativity constrained because "failure's not an option." I
know what it's like to want to do better, but be told "it's good enough." I know
what it's like to be stuck.

Being stuck is a horrible state to be in. Maybe you're stuck because of the
technology you're using, or maybe it's your boss or your organization, maybe
it's the system, but whatever the case, there you are, unchanging, unmoving, not
growing, stuck.

Needless to say, being stuck is not fun.

## Encouraging Growth

The whole premise of this post is that if you're having fun, you're most likely
growing as a developer; if you're not having fun, then you're not growing as
much as you could. If you're not growing as much as you would like, then
something needs to change, and maybe several "somethings". 

What follows is a list of some ideas you should try in order to rekindle your
love and excitement for the art. This is not an exhaustive list, and I would
love to hear from you what things you've tried to get the development juices
flowing.

* Keep lists of researchables: I have a list - it sounds more organized than it
  is - I use to keep track of words, concepts, and ideas that I want to
research. When I get a few minutes (between test runs) I go and look things up.
* Develop a low pain threshold: We create applications to solve problems. Pay
  attention to those little annoyances and find a programmatic way of solving
them. e.g. Be annoyed by the way your editor behaves and find a way to fix it.
* Play more: 
  * Take some time to tweak your configuration files; especially
    [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [VIM](http://www.vim.org/),
[Git](http://git-scm.com/), or shell configs.
  * Experiment with a new library or language
  * Force a limitation on yourself: examples, try to use recursion instead of
    loops; use methods instead of constants; read source code in place of
documentation; etc. See also [Creative Limitations](//samuelmullen.com/2011/04/creative-limitations/)
  * Participate in a [Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)
* Find other developers who are passionate and start hanging out with them,
  especially if they're better than you.
  * Check out your local user groups
  * Go to conferences
  * Find a mentor
  * Find a way, but make those connections
* Start contributing to a
  [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software) project
* Try playing with some [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) or [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) projects?

The point is to play and to have fun, and to remind yourself how much fun
programming is. Yeah, at times programming is difficult and sometimes it's even
a chore, but you know from your past that it doesn't have to be that way, and
you know from your experience that it shouldn't be that way. If you are at a
point where you find yourself incapable of growth, maybe it's time for a change;
maybe a drastic change.

Because, let's face it, "If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong."
