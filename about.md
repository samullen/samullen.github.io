<p>I live in the greater Kansas City area with my beautiful wife, our two great
kids, our dog, and our cat. I'm a freelancer software developer specializing in
Ruby, JavaScript, and Elixir, and I love what I do.</p>

<p>I'm a highly versatile software developer, and have programmed professionally
since 1997 using a host of languages and technologies. Before freelancing, my
employers ranged from fortune 500 companies such as <a href="http://spring.com">Sprint</a> and <a href="http://lilly.com">Eli Lilly</a>, to smaller organizations like <a href="http://universaluclick.com">Andrews McMeel</a> and a couple startups.</p>

<p>I began freelancing in 2009 when my manager asked me to build a web-based
tool "on the side" for her uncle's company. Shortly thereafter, the company I
worked for began a series of layoffs. Although I was not let go, I recognized
that no company was looking out for my best interests and the only way to assure
my security was to take control of my employment. I began looking for more
clients to add to my portfolio, and within two years I was fully
independent.</p>

<p>Since entering the workforce, the Internet has blossomed and grown, and I
have grown with it. I remember what it was like to build everything from
scratch, which may be why I get so excited about new technology; it promises
to simplify that which was previously difficult. My eye is always on the
future and as such, I am very aware of new technologies as they arise, even
if I don't immediately adopt them.</p>

<p>Technology is ever-changing and I continually pursue what's coming next,
but with the understanding that companies still have to deal with current
technologies. It's exciting to work with companies who are trying to do the next
big thing, but there's just as much excitement to get out of helping companies
maintain existing projects.</p>

<h3>Everything Else</h3>
<p>When I'm not working, you will likely find me watching my kids' soccer games, working out, reading, attending church, or just spending time with my family.</p>
